## Why American Women Are Talking About the 4B Movement After Trump's Re-election

In the wake of Donald Trump’s re-election, many American women are talking about the “4B movement” — a term that has recently made waves on social media. But what exactly is it, and why is it trending now?

## What Is the 4B Movement?

The 4B movement originally began in South Korea as part of a radical feminist stance. Its core idea is to encourage women to cut off interactions with men, protesting against what they see as a deeply patriarchal society. The “4B” refers to four key “Nos” in Korean:

- **“Bisekseu”**: No sex with men
- **“Biyeonae”**: No dating men
- **“Bihon”**: No marriage to men
- **“Bichulsan”**: No children with men

### A Long-Standing Idea

The concept of women withholding interaction from men as a form of protest is not new. One of the earliest examples of this can be traced back to ancient Greece, in Aristophanes' play *Lysistrata* (411 BC). In the comedy, women withhold sex from their husbands as a way to pressure them into ending the Peloponnesian War. It’s a strategy of using sexual and social power as leverage to bring about change.

### How Did It Start in South Korea?

The 4B movement started gaining traction around 2016, inspired by the *Escape the Corset* movement. This was a social media-driven wave where South Korean women began to voice their frustrations about the unrealistic beauty standards and patriarchal pressures placed on them. The momentum grew even further in 2017 when the *#MeToo* movement sparked a national conversation about sexual harassment and abuse in South Korea.

## Why Is It Trending in the U.S. Now?

The rise of the 4B movement in the U.S. is tied directly to the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. When the results were announced earlier this week, interest in the movement surged, with Google searches spiking by 450%. The hashtag “#4B” trended across social media platforms, with over 200,000 people seeking more information about it.

## What’s the Connection to Donald Trump?

The link between Trump’s re-election and the resurgence of the 4B movement is clear. Under his leadership, the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade* effectively stripped away federal abortion rights, a move that many women view as a direct attack on their autonomy. Furthermore, Trump’s public history of misogyny, including multiple accusations of sexual assault and the infamous $80 million settlement for sexual abuse, has set the tone for the Republican Party’s stance on women’s rights. 

What’s more concerning for many women is the growing influence of figures like Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan, whose misogynistic rhetoric is resonating with younger men. Trump’s re-election has reinforced a cultural shift that many women find troubling, and the 4B movement is seen by some as a direct response to this.

## Will the 4B Movement Have an Impact?

So, will the 4B movement actually “work”? In the strictest sense, no — it’s unlikely that all women will suddenly abstain from any interaction with men. But that doesn’t mean the movement won’t make a difference. For one, its sudden rise on social media has already sparked important conversations about misogyny, women’s rights, and the state of gender relations. Even if only a small number of women adopt the movement’s principles, its cultural impact is undeniable.

Already, the mere threat of the movement has riled up Trump supporters, proving that it’s striking a nerve. If nothing else, the 4B movement is shining a spotlight on the ways in which societal norms continue to suppress women’s autonomy. And who knows? Perhaps, as more women continue to express their frustration, it could spark real, meaningful change.
